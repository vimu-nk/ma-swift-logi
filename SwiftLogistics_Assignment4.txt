Middleware Architecture (SCS2314) Assignment 4 – Middleware Architecture
for “SwiftLogistics” (Release date: 12 January 2026, Deadline: 28
February 2026) 1.Objective The primary objective is to design and
implement a technology solution based on the knowledge and understanding
of middleware architectures and related technologies to realise a
prototype solution for a given business scenario. 2.Introduction This
assignment is designed to be a collaborative group effort. Its primary
objective is to provide a hands-on opportunity t o a p p l y t h e t h e
o r etical knowledge of middleware architecture principles and related
technologies to a real-world business scenario. Working in a team will
allow you to simulate the dynamics of a professional software
development environment, where collective problem-solving and the
integration of diverse ideas are essential for success. All teams will
be given the same detailed business scenario. Your task is to: 1.Design
a robust and scalable middleware architecture to solve the business
problem. 2.Implement a functional prototype of the core components of
your proposed solution. The entire solution—from design to
implementation—must be based on open-source technologies. This is a
deliberate constraint to encourage you to explore the rich ecosystem of
open-source tools that are frequently used in the industry. As you will
discover, a wide range of open-source tools and frameworks are available
to build the essential components of a modern middleware solution,

•Service Communication: Frameworks for creating SOAP and RESTful
services (e.g., Spring Boot, Flask, FastAPI, Node.js Express). •Service
Orchestration: Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) technologies or
microservices frameworks for managing complex business processes and
data ﬂows. •Asynchronous Communication: Publish-subscribe message
brokers for high-volume, asynchronous messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache
Kafka). •Service Discovery and Registry: Tools for managing and locating
services in a distributed environment. •Data Persistence: Database
systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing application data. Each
team is encouraged to research and select the most suitable combination
of these technologies to realise an effective and well-justiﬁed
architecture for the given business scenario. The freedom to choose your
technology stack is a key part of the assignment, allowing you to
demonstrate your critical thinking and architectural decision-making
skills. 3.Duration and Team Composition The assignment duration is 6
weeks (deadline: 28 February 2026) and should be completed in teams of
5-6 students. 4.Submission Guidelines The submission should comply with
the following guidelines. The source code, documentation and the
presentation screencast should be uploaded to the VLE. 1.The Solution
Documentation sho uld be s ub mitted in PDF format. The index number of
each group member who contributed should be stated in the documentation.

comprehensive report detailing the proposed solution/middleware
architecture. This should include architectural diagrams, a justiﬁcation
for technology choices (e.g., why a speciﬁc middleware component is
used), and a discussion of how each of the challenges is addressed.
2.The Source Code of the solution should be compressed and submitted
together with the project documentation. 3.Presentation of the solution:
A n o v e r a l l p r e s e n t ation (less than 10 minutes) of the
proposed solution architecture and technology should be recorded as a
screencast and uploaded to the VLE. The presentation should primarily
focus on a detailed description of the solution architecture, the
rationale for combining the architectural patterns to solve the overall
solution, and a brief functional demo. The screencast presentation
should be voiced/narrated by the team members. 5.Evaluation Guidelines
The evaluation of the assignment would be done based on the following
criteria. 1.Evaluation of the solution documentation - The documentation
should cover the following aspects. a.Introduction to the solution.
b.The architecture of the solution – conceptual and implementation
architectures to be drawn and discussed. Propose 2 alternative
architectures that could be used to implement the solution and state the
rationale for using the proposed ﬁnal architecture for the
implementation. c.The Architectural Patterns used in the solution. You
should describe the architectural and integration patterns used to
connect the components of the overall architecture. Describe the
rationale for selecting the proposed Architectural and Integration
Patterns. Middleware Architecture, (SCS2314), UCSC, Jan 2026 | Page of

d.Prototype: A minimal implementation that mocks the functionalities of
the CMS, ROS, and WMS as described in section 6. The prototype should
demonstrate a basic order submission ﬂow, showing how the architecture
orchestrates the communication between the three mock systems and
provides real-time updates to a simple client UI. The implementation of
the real-time tracking and notiﬁcation system should be architecturally
described, but only minimally implemented. e.List the information
security c o n s i d e r ations taken during the design and
implementation of the solution. 2.Evaluation of the solution through a
group presentation. a.The group members should use a voiced/narrated
screencast video to describe the aspects described in section (1) above.
b.Each member of the group should participate in the presentation.
6.Assignment Scenario: Middleware Architecture for “SwiftLogistics”
Swift Logistics (Pvt) Ltd. is a rapidly growing logistics company in Sri
Lanka, specialising in last-mile delivery for e-commerce businesses.
They offer delivery services for a range of clients, from large online
retailers to small-scale independent sellers. To scale their operations
and stay competitive, they are replacing their siloed, manual systems
with a modern, integrated platform. The new platform is a web-based
portal and a mobile application for drivers, both branded as
“SwiftTrack.” The core challenge is to integrate three critical systems
that currently operate independently, seamlessly: 1.Client Management
System (CMS): A legacy, on-premise system that handles client contracts,
billing, and order intake. It exposes a SOAP-based XML API. Middleware

2.Route Optimisation System (ROS): A modern, cloud-based service from a
third-party vendor that takes delivery addresses and vehicle
availability to generate the most efficient routes. It has a
well-documented RESTful API. 3.Warehouse Management System (WMS): A
system that tracks packages within the warehouse, from the moment they
are received from a client to when they are loaded onto a vehicle. It
offers a proprietary messaging protocol over TCP/IP for real-time
updates. Functional Requirements for “SwiftTrack” The new “SwiftTrack”
platform needs to provide the following functionalities: •Client Portal:
E-commerce clients should be able to log in, view the status of their
submitted orders, and track deliveries in real-time. •Driver Mobile App:
Drivers should be able to: ◦View their assigned delivery manifest and
optimised route for the day. ◦Receive real-time updates on route changes
or new high-priority deliveries. ◦Mark packages as “delivered” or
“failed” with reasons (e.g., recipient not available). ◦Capture a
customer’s digital signature or take a photo as proof of delivery.
•Order Intake and Processing: ◦Clients submit orders through the portal,
which are then passed to the WMS for processing and to the ROS for route
planning. ◦The system must handle high volumes of incoming orders,
especially during promotional events like “Black Friday” or “Avurudu”
sales. ◦The architecture must ensure that an order is never lost during
the process, even if one of the back-end systems is temporarily
unavailable. Middleware Architecture, (SCS2314), UCSC, Jan 2026 | Page

Speciﬁc Architectural Challenges & Considerations 1.Heterogeneous
Systems Integration: The proposed architecture must bridge the gap
between the CMS (SOAP/XML), the ROS (REST/JSON), and the WMS
(proprietary TCP/IP messaging). This requires a robust mechanism for
protocol and data format translation. 2.Real-time Tracking and
Notiﬁcations: The system needs to provide real-time updates to clients
and drivers. For instance, when a driver marks a package as delivered,
the client portal should reﬂect this change immediately. This also
includes push notiﬁcations to drivers for urgent route changes.
3.High-Volume, Asynchronous Processing: Order processing, especially for
a large number of orders, can be time-consuming. The system should not
block the client portal while waiting for the ROS to optimise a route or
for the WMS to conﬁrm a package is ready. The solution should use an
architectural pattern that supports this high-volume, asynchronous
communication. 4.Transaction Management: A single client order triggers
multiple actions across different systems (e.g., creating an order in
CMS, adding a package to WMS, and adding a delivery point to ROS). The
architecture must ensure the consistency of this distributed
transaction. Propose the methods the system would use to recover when
one or more steps in a transaction fail. 5.Scalability and Resilience:
The proposed architecture must be able to scale to handle an increasing
number of clients, drivers, and daily deliveries. It should also be
resilient to the failure of any single component. 6.Security: All
communication, especially between the client portal and the backend, and
with external APIs like the ROS, must be secure. Middleware
